                <p>I am a 28 year old graduate of Graduate of Georgia State University in Atlanta, Georgia. I obtained a Bachelor's Degree in Political Science in 2019. The following year the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown began and so did my search to find a job. With much uncertainty in the world I used the various skills that I posses in video production and photography to sustain myself while living with my parents. As the population began to return to a somewhat normal state I was able to start a career in sales. I believe sales is a valuable skill that everyone should posses and it has taught me many valuable lessons. However, I knew that I had to diversify my skillset if I wanted to have the ability to have more flexibility in my schedule. That being said I registered for the Full-Stack coding bootcamp at UCF with the intention of learning the skill of web development and app development.</p>
